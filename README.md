## purpose

I have learn programming for a long time, but I think I make little progress in programming and I want to make a change.

I'd like to do more code exercise and strengthen my thinking in programs. It is not a easy task, but I will try to step forward little by little.

The key is to move on at once and stick to it after all

## beginging

Let's start it!
